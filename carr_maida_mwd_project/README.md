# Carr Maida MWD Project

Authors: Johnny Carr and Taylor Maida

This web-based app can be used to assist in planning your next party! Our goal is that it can be used to send invitations, and invited guests will be able to enter song recommendations for the hosts to decide upon for the party playlist.

Additionally, there will be a Purchasing feature that will assist in managing who has bought what for the party and keep track of expenses per person. Finally, each user will have a main hub where they are able to see what events they are currently signed up for to help them plan their time better!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Notes for Feature 6
While our original user stories each included designing a page and pair programming the Spotify API, we realized that the Spotify API was a lot more work than we originally thought, so while our design isn't the best, we want it to be clear that we spent a large majority of our time on the Spotify part of the project.

### Access

Our app uses the Spotify Web API, in order to use the full functionality of the app you must request access to\
the app's Spotify dashboard by contacting us. Thank you.
