# Carr_Maida_MWD_Project

Authors: Johnny Carr and Taylor Maida
This web-based app can be used to assist in planning your next party! Our goal is that it can be used to send invitations, and invited guests will be able to enter song recommendations for the hosts to decide upon for the party playlist. 
Additionally, there will be a Purchasing feature that will assist in managing who has bought what for the party and keep track of expenses per person. 
Finally, each user will have a main hub where they are able to see what events they are currently signed up for to help them plan their time better!
